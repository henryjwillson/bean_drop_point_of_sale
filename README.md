This unit is running on a varient of Debian Linux. The hardware involved is a custom pcb board, a small single board computer, a thermal printer, a camera module and a rfid scanner module. 

The main file to run is named: 'POS_GUI_Rev1_8T_MySQL.py'. This is normally executed by an executable file deployed outside of the project folders. All other files supliment and help run 'POS_GUI_Rev1_8T_MySQL.py'. Code makes used of class based OOP throughout.

# Hidden Code and Functions
As a commercial product, a number of code sections have been removed to protect Bean Drop Ltd's product. The hidden sections are listed below along with links to operational demos of the hidden sections functionality.
- Connect_functions.py has a significant number of functions removed/hidden as part of commercial security as they access the Bean Drop production database. The connect_functions.py uses a class named 'server_connection_details' to access our mySQL database based on the Google clound using the mysql.connector library and SSL connection protocols. 10 / 61 class based methods are shown in the code as examples, however even amoungst the examples shown, table/column names have been changes / retracted as part of commercial security. 'XXX' is often used to replace names in the code. 
- Significant number of class based tkinter Frames from 'POS_GUI_Rev1_8T_MySQL.py' have also been removed / hidden. A number of Example frames have already been provided and represent the same quality of code in the hidden frames. 5/24 Class based tkinter frames are shown, the rest are hidden. These hidden frames are shown to be operational here:
- .gitignore is setup to not track files within certs folder 

*Note: The Bean Drop 'Point of Sale Attachment' is not a True Point of Sale as it does not process any payments directly (card or cash), however it succurely updates user accounts in the Bean Drop database which contain 'cup deposits'
