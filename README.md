# Hidden Code and Functions
As a commercial product, a number of code sections have been removed to protect Bean Drop Ltd's product. The hidden sections are listed below along with links to operational demos of the hidden sections functionality.
- Encryption and new user account generation
- Hardware status and database connection monitoring
- Connect_functions.py has a significant number of functions removed/hidden as part of commercial security as they access the Bean Drop production database.
- Significant number of class based tkinter Frames from 'POS_GUI_Rev1_8T_MySQL.py' have also been removed / hidden. A number of Example frames have already been provided and represent the same quality of code in the hidden frames. These hidden frames are shown to be operational here:
